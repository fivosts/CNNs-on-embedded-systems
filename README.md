This repository is my implementation of a generic framework to deploy CNNs (Convolutional Neural Nets) on "Myriad 2" VPU (Movidius, Intel).

To understand the project and its functionalities, you can read our [CODES+ISSS 2018 paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326485881_A_Design_Space_Exploration_Framework_for_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_implemented_on_Edge_Devices). For a more detailed/technical description, please take a look at my [thesis document](http://dspace.lib.ntua.gr/handle/123456789/47506?locale-attribute=en). Chapters 4 to 9 are a thorough analysis of how things work, although not perfectly written/explained.

This project consists my thesis from the school of electrical and computer engineering, NTUA, Athens, Greece. The code is explicitely oriented to the specs and needs of this system. However, I am releasing open source almost the whole project, because I believe it holds great ideas that could be imported to different platforms that try to fulfill the same purpose.

I omitted unimportant config files due to classified architectural details of the embedded system.

For any queries or anything else regarding this project, you can contact me at my email, fivos_ts@hotmail.com
